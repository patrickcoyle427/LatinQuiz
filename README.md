# How to build:

Notes for myself, this will be removed once this is finished.

-Loads in the csv file from http://dcc.dickinson.edu/latin-vocabulary-list

-Parses list and pulls in words + definitions.

-Quizes the user
 -Lets you choose a # of questions.
 -Lets you choose a maximum frequency ranking (lower number = more common)
 -Should do definitions, but maybe could also quiz on parts of a sentence?
 -Displays a score and a letter grade at the end.

## Long-term additions
